                <p>There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals[3] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.[4][5][6] The term "Yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures or asanas.

                    The practice of yoga has been thought to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions; possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda,[note 1] and also referenced in the Upanishads,[8] though it most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements.[9][note 2] The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads.[10] The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the 2nd century BCE,[11][12] and gained prominence in the west in the 20th century after being first introduced by Swami Vivekananda.[13] Hatha yoga texts began to emerge sometime between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra.

                <p>A yogi is a practitioner of yoga,[1] including a sannyasin or practitioner of meditation in Indian religions.[2] The feminine form, sometimes used in English, is yogini.

                    Yogi has since the 12th century CE also denoted members of the Nath siddha tradition of Hinduism,[3] and in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, a practitioner of tantra.[4][5] In Hindu mythology, the god Shiva and the goddess Parvati are depicted as an emblematic yogi–yogini pair.
